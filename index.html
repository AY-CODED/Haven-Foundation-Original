          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>
            A few years back, God gave me a project to work on. Although I knew
            I was meant to undertake it, I was scared to start and doubted my
            capacity to handle such a significant task, even though I had
            already navigated similar experiences. Fear held me back, making me
            question whether I could truly succeed.
            <br />
            Over time, I realized that God would never assign me a huge project
            without equipping me with the necessary abilities. Last year, in
            2023, I met Mr. @tunde_rhema, the CEO of @tr_leadershiphub. He gave
            me a scholarship for one of their programs. Despite having other
            business ventures that needed clarification, this project was the
            only one that felt right to focus on. Together, we developed a
            blueprint outlining how the project could work and identified the
            key elements to include.
            <br />
            Even after everything was prepared, I found many reasons not to
            start because fear crept in again. I began to ask myself if I was
            truly ready, so I left the project. About two months ago, the Holy
            Spirit started reminding me of the project I had neglected, and it
            became a burden on my heart. Just three weeks ago, during a service
            at Menorah, while our pastor was ministering, I heard the Holy
            Spirit speak to me in a clear voice, as if He were sitting right
            next to me. He said, "I took you through that process to help
            others." My heart melted, and I was broken. At that moment, I knew I
            couldn't run anymore. Right then and there, I began to ask for
            strength because I knew I couldn't do it all by myself.
            <br />
            We are a community whose foundation is built on God's instructions
            to help people through the pain and process that he took us through.
